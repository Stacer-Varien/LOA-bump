# Terms and Services when using LOA Bump (Bot ID 728945415105282059)

## Illicit Servers and/or Ads
Servers and ads that promote/mention illicit activities/content such as raiding, hate speech, child pornography, hacking, etc are NOT allowed to be bumped across other servers. These kinds of server violates the Discord's [ToS](https://discord.com/terms) and [Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)


## NSFW Servers
NSFW servers are forbidden to be bumped but servers that have locked NSFW channels and not mainly focused on sexual content is allowed.


## Defamation and Reputational Harm
Spreading rumours and false reports about LOA Bump (such as calling it a nuke bot), causing unwanted drama or attacking the developer will not be tolerated.

## Always Report Illicit Servers
As mentioned under 'Illicit Servers and/or Ads', always report illicit servers/ads if you have come across them.

## Selbotting
Bumping of servers must be done manually by the user only. This includes the use of autotypers, macros or anything that automates accounts as they are not allowed.

## Invite Reward Based Servers
Invite reward based servers are strictly not allowed to be bump.

## If your server/ad does not respect the ToS as above, LOA Bump will either leave your server, deletes your ad and your server maybe be blacklisted (in other words, banned from being bumped)
